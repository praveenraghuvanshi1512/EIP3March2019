## Convolution

Convolution is the method of combining two functions to generate the third function. In neural networks, it's widely used for image recognition. A model is developed to identify objects in an image. Convolution Neural Network(CNN) involve multiple hidden layers for identifying patterns in an image. A general sequence of identifying the object in an image involves identifying Edges/Gradient followed by Texture followed by Patterns followed by Part of objects and finally an object.

## Epochs

An epoch is a term used in deep neural networks. One epoch is a single pass through of a model across whole training set. It involves covering both forward and backward pass through. Number of epoch influence the efficiency of a model and may increase or decrease it. More the number of epochs, more time will be taken to execute a model. Time to complete an epoch increases as we increase the training set.
