## Convolution

Convolution is the method of combining two functions to generate the third function. In neural networks, it's widely used for image recognition. A model is developed to identify objects in an image. Convolution Neural Network(CNN) involve multiple hidden layers for identifying patterns in an image. A general sequence of identifying the object in an image involves identifying Edges/Gradient followed by Texture followed by Patterns followed by Part of objects and finally an object.
